`anatomix` is a general-purpose feature extractor for 3D volumes. For any new biomedical dataset or task,
- Its out-of-the-box features are invariant to most forms of nuisance imaging variation.
- Its out-of-the-box weights are a good initialization for finetuning when given limited annotations.

Without any dataset or domain specific pretraining, this respectively leads to:
- SOTA 3D training-free multi-modality image registration
- SOTA 3D few-shot semantic segmentation

**How?** It's weights were contrastively pretrained on wildly variable synthetic
volumes to learn approximate appearance invariance and pose
equivariance for images with randomly sampled biomedical shape configurations with
random intensities and artifacts.


## Load weights for inference / feature extraction / finetuning

`anatomix` is just a pretrained UNet! Use it for whatever you like.

```python
import torch
from anatomix.model.network import Unet

model = Unet(
    dimension=3,  # Only 3D supported for now
    input_nc=1,  # number of input channels
    output_nc=16,  # number of output channels
    num_downs=4,  # number of downsampling layers
    ngf=16,  # channel multiplier
)
model.load_state_dict(
    torch.load("./model-weights/anatomix.pth"),
    strict=True,
)
```

See how to use it on real data for feature extraction or registration in [this tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1shivu4GtUoiDzDrE9RKD1RuEm3OqXJuD?usp=sharing). Or if you want to finetune for your own task, check out [this tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WBslSRLgAAMq6o5YFif1y0kaW9Ac15XK?usp=sharing) instead.

(If your task involves brains, you might benefit by using the `anatomix+brains.pth` weights instead, where we synthesize training volumes using both our synthetic label ensembles and real brain labels.)

## Install dependencies:

All scripts will require the `anatomix` environment defined below to run.

```
conda create -n anatomix python=3.9
conda activate anatomix
git clone https://github.com/neel-dey/anatomix.git
cd anatomix
pip install -e .
```

Or install the dependencies manually:
```
conda create -n anatomix python=3.9
conda activate anatomix
pip install numpy==1.24.1 nibabel scipy scikit-image nilearn h5py matplotlib torch==2.0.1 tensorboard tqdm monai==1.3.2 torchio SimpleITK
```

## Folder organization

This repository contains:
- Model weights for `anatomix` (and its variants)
- Scripts for 3D nonrigid registration using `anatomix` features
- Scripts for finetuning `anatomix` weights for semantic segmentation.

Each subfolder (described below) has its own README to detail its use.

```bash

## Roadmap

The current repository is just an initial push. It will be refactored 
and some quality-of-life and core aspects will be pushed as well in the coming weeks.
These include:
- [x] Contrastive pretraining code 
- [x] Colab 3D feature extraction tutorial
- [x] Colab 3D multimodality registration tutorial
- [x] Colab 3D few-shot finetuning tutorial
- [ ] General-purpose registration interface with [FireANTs](https://github.com/rohitrango/FireANTs)
- [ ] Dataset-specific modeling details for paper
